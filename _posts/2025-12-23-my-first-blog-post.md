title: "My First Blog Post"
---
Hi! Welcome to my first blog post. Here, I'll explain to you who I am, why I made a blog, and what I'm going to post here.

### Who am I?

I go by Mostlime, but my real name is Karo. As of writing, I'm a 17-year-old senior in high school, with a six-year-long hobby in software engineering.

### My beliefs

I'm a firm believer in involving myself in any subject I'm interested in. While software engineering is my central focus, I spend a lot of time teaching myself art, music, and writing, among other areas. This allows me to generalize my abilities into things like game development, which typically require more than one core skill.

### Why a blog?

I enjoy writing. I also enjoy journaling my work over time, and showing others my thought process during the development of some of my projects.

### What will I write here?

I'll write based on a variety of topics here, like
- Posts explaining my thought process during the development of some of my projects (like Hack Search, a search engine created from scratch to index 10M pages in 15gb of storage space.)
- Showcase updates on some of my projects.
- Talk about things I'm passionate about. Remember, I'm not only a programmer! You might find me talking about subjects entirely unrelated to programming, or unrelated to computers in general.

I don't have a set post schedule and will post whenever inspiration strikes, so if you want to read any of my content in the future feel free to add this website to your RSS feed [using the site's RSS](https://mostlime12195.github.io/feed.xml). You can take a look at the (100% JS-free) code for my website at [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mostlime12195/mostlime12195.github.io).
